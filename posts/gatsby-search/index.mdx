A search bar is a great way to make content on your Gatsby site discoverable.
In this tutorial, I'll be walking you through how to add search to Gatsby with [FlexSearch](https://www.github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch).

I'll be basing the code off Gatsby's official starter blog template, [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
We'll also be using a [React search bar component](https://emgoto.com/react-search-bar) I built in a previous post.

At the end of the tutorial, you will have a search bar that allows readers to search through your posts:

## Choosing a search library for Gatsby

Do you _need_ a search library? Not always. It is possible to write a filter that finds partial matches based off post titles. 
But if you have a lot of posts, or you want to search off many fields, a search library may be for you.

There are quite a few JavaScript search libraries out there that you can make use of.
I chose [FlexSearch](https://www.github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) due to its ease of setup. It also claims to be the fastest search library. Sounds pretty good to me!

## Add a search bar component to your Gatsby site
We'll be putting our search bar on the home page.

The home page uses a GraphQL page query to grab a list of all the posts, and then loops through and renders a link out to each post.

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
import PostLink from '../components/post-link';

export default ({
    data: {
        allMarkdownRemark: { nodes },
    },
}) => {
    const posts = nodes;

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blog</h1>
            {posts.map(post =>
                // PostLink will be a component that renders a summary of your post
                // e.g. the title, date and an excerpt
                <PostLink post={post} />
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
      nodes {
        excerpt
        fields {
          slug
        }
        frontmatter {
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Create a separate `search.js` file to store your search bar component:
```jsx:title=src/components/search.js
import React from 'react';

const SearchBar = ({ searchQuery, setSearchQuery }) => (
    <form
        action="/"
        method="get"
        autoComplete="off"
    >
        <label htmlFor="header-search">
            <span className="visually-hidden">
                Search blog posts
            </span>
        </label>
        <input
            value={searchQuery}
            onInput={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
            type="text"
            id="header-search"
            placeholder="Search blog posts"
            name="s"
        />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
);
```

As well as some CSS to hide our screen reader-friendly label:
```css:title=src/pages/index.css
.visually-hidden {
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
    white-space: nowrap;
    width: 1px;
}
```

> I've written a separate post going into detail on how to create an [accessible search bar component](https://emgoto.com/react-search-bar).

Then on our home page we can add this new search component:
```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react';
import Search from '../components/search'; // highlight-line
import './index.css'; // highlight-line

export default ({
    data: {
        allMarkdownRemark: { nodes },
    },
}) => {
    /* highlight-range{1-3} */
    const { search } = window.location;
    const query = new URLSearchParams(search).get('s')
    const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(query || '');

    const posts = nodes;

   return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blog</h1>
            {/* highlight-range{1-4} */}
            <SearchBar
                searchQuery={searchQuery}
                setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
            />
            {posts.map(post => (
                <PostLink post={post} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};
```

Now you‚Äôll have a search bar component set up on your Gatsby site.

## Install gatsby-plugin-local-search and FlexSearch

Now that we have our search bar, we'll need to hook it up to a search library.

The Gatsby ecosystem has plugins for every occassion - and search is no exception! 

First, install [gatsby-plugin-local-search](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-local-search/):
```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-local-search
```

This plugin handles integrating your Gatsby blog with a search engine library. On top of this plugin, we‚Äôll also need to install our search library, FlexSearch:
```bash
yarn add flexsearch react-use-flexsearch
```
We‚Äôre also installing a react-use-flexsearch hook, which will make it easier to use FlexSearch later.

## Update your Gatsby config file

As with all Gatsby plugins, once you have installed the plugin you will need to add it to your Gatsby config file.
```js:title=gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-local-search',
        options: {
            name: 'pages',
            engine: 'flexsearch',
            query: /** TODO **/,
            ref: /** TODO **/,
            index: /** TODO **/,
            store: /** TODO **/,
            normalizer: /** TODO **/,
        }
    },
```

I‚Äôve left most of the options values blank, since these are going to be individual to your site. We‚Äôll be covering them one-by-one below.

### Adding the query value
The first value we need to add to our plugin‚Äôs options is the `query`. This GraphQL query needs to grab the data for all your posts.
This is the same query that we used earlier on the home page of our Gatsby site:
```js
query: `
  query {
    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
      nodes {
        excerpt
        fields {
          slug
        }
        frontmatter {
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

### Choosing a ref value
The `ref` is a value unique to each blog post. If your posts have unique slugs, you can use that.
```js
ref: 'slug'
```

> üí° **What is a slug?**
>
> If you have a post living at the URL `website.com/foo-bar`, the slug is the `foo-bar` bit. A slug value is usually calculated in your `gatsby-node.js` file.

If your site doesn‚Äôt have slugs, GraphQL provides an ID for each of your posts, so you can use that for your ref:

```graphql
query {
    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
        nodes {
            id  // highlight-line
```

### Adding an index value
Our next value is the `index`. This is the array of values that you want FlexSearch to search from. 
The most likely thing you‚Äôll be adding is the `title`, but you might also want users to search the post's excerpt or tags as well.

```js
index: ['title', 'excerpt']
```

### Adding a store value
Next is the `store`. When FlexSearch returns search results, this is the data you want in those results.
For example if you're going to render the date under every post, you'll want the date value.

You‚Äôll also need to include in the store your ref and index values as well.
```js
store: ['title', 'excerpt', 'date', 'slug']
```

### Adding a normalizer value
The final step is the `normalizer`. 
FlexSearch expects all the values that you listed above in the `store` to be returned in a flat shape like this:

```js
{
    title: 'Foo',
    excerpt: 'Blah blah salted duck eggs'
	date: '2020-01-01',
    slug: 'foo-bar'
}
```
We need a function that will transform the data from our GraphQL query into the expected shape:

```js
normalizer: ({ data }) =>
    data.allMarkdownRemark.nodes.map(node => ({
        title: node.frontmatter.title,
        excerpt: node.excerpt,
        date: node.frontmatter.date,
        slug: node.fields.slug,
    })),
```

## Add your FlexSearch engine to your search bar

Now that we‚Äôve set up FlexSearch, we can finally start using it for our search bar.
```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { graphql } from 'gatsby';
import { useFlexSearch } from 'react-use-flexsearch'; // highlight-line

export default ({
    data: {
        localSearchPages: { index, store }, // highlight-line
        allMarkdownRemark: { nodes },
    },
}) => {
    const { search } = window.location;
    const query = new URLSearchParams(search).get('s');
    const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(query || '');

    const posts = nodes;
    const results = useFlexSearch(searchQuery, index, store); // highlight-line

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blog</h1>
            <Search
				searchQuery={searchQuery}
                setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
			/>
            {posts.map(post => (
                <LinkComponent post={post} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    /* highlight-range{1-4} */
    localSearchPages {
      index
      store
    }
    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
      nodes {
        excerpt
        fields {
          slug
        }
        frontmatter {
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

### Make sure to un-normalize the data
The `results` returned from the FlexSearch hook are going to be in a ‚Äúflat‚Äù shape like this:
```js
{
    title: 'Foo',
    tags: ['tag'],
	date: '2020-01-01',
    slug: 'foo-bar'
}
```

Our link component will be expecting the post to be in the same shape as what our GraphQL query returns.
So we can write a function to put this data back into its expected shape:
```js
export const unFlattenResults = results =>
    results.map(post => {
        const { date, slug, tags, title } = post;
        return { slug, frontmatter: { title, date, tags } };
    });
```

And then pass in our results:
```jsx
const results = useFlexSearch(searchQuery, index, store);
const posts = unflattenResults(results); // highlight-line

return (
    <>
        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <Search
            searchQuery={searchQuery}
            setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
        />
        {posts.map(post => (
            <LinkComponent post={post} />
        ))}
    </>
);
```
### Accounting for an empty query
The FlexSearch engine will return no results if you have an empty query. The behaviour that you want here instead is to show _all_ the results.

When the search query is empty, we can fall back to using the original data we were getting from our GraphQL query.

```jsx
const results = useFlexSearch(searchQuery, index, store);
// If a user has typed in a query, use the search results. Otherwise, use all posts
const posts = searchQuery ? unflattenResults(results) : nodes; // highlight-line

return (
    <>
        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <Search
            searchQuery={searchQuery}
            setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
        />
        {posts.map(post => (
            <LinkComponent post={post} />
        ))}
    </>
);
```
Now, you will have finished setting up the search bar set up on your Gatsby site!
With search implemented, your readers can now look for the content that is most relevant to them.
