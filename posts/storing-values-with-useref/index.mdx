React's `useRef` hook is used to store references to DOM elements. But did you know you can store and update values with `useRef`?

## Storing element references with useRef

As the name suggests, `useRef` can store a reference to a DOM element. To do this, create the ref, and then pass it into the element:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const ref = useRef(null);
    return <div ref={ref}> Hello world </div>;
};
```

With this reference, you can do lots of useful things like:

* Grabbing an element's height and width
* Seeing whether a scrollbar is present
* Calling `focus()` on the element at a certain moment

## Storing and updating values with useRef

Another use-case for `useRef` allows us to store values, which you can later use and change:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const ref = useRef({
        renderCount: 0
    });

    // Increase the render count on every re-render
    ref.current.renderCount += 1;

    return <>Hello world</>;
}
```

To change the ref's value, you will need to change `ref.current` (and not `ref` itself!)

## useRef vs useState: What's wrong with useState?

The key difference between `useState` and `useRef` is that:

* If you update the state, your component will re-render
* If you update the value stored in your ref, nothing will happen

If you donâ€™t need the component to re-render (or you don't _want_ the component to re-render), `useRef` may be a good candidate.

## Whatâ€™s the difference between useRef and using a variable?

If you tried initializing a variable like this: 

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    let renderCount = 0;
    renderCount += 1;

    return <>Hello world</>;
}
```

It would get end up getting re-initialized each time the component renders. If you use a ref, the value you store in it will persist between renders of your component.

## What about if I define the variable outside of the component?

If you initialize the value outside of your component, this value will be global to all instances of `Component`.

So if you change the value, it will affect the value for all the other components you have rendered on your page.

```jsx
let renderCount = 0;

const Component = () => {
    // If you had 10 Components on the page, they would all update the same
    // renderCount value and it would already be at 10 after one render!
    renderCount += 1;
    return <>Hello world</>;
}
```

## useRef vs createRef

`createRef` is the API that React provided for refs before hooks came around:

```jsx
import { createRef } from 'react';

class Component extends React.Component() {
    ref = createRef();

    render() {
        this.ref.renderCount += 1;
        return <div>Hello world</div>;
    }
}
```

If you're using functional components I would recommend using `useRef` over `createRef`.

## How to use useRef in class components

As `useRef` is a hook, it will only work with functional components.

With class components, you can use the `createRef()` example I showed above.

You can also achieve the same thing using a class variable:

```jsx
class Component extends React.Component() {
    renderCount = 0;

    render() {
        this.renderCount += 1;
        return <div>Hello world</div>;
    }
}
```
