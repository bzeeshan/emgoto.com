# Uses

Here are some of the tools I use on a daily basis.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/)
* [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/) internet blocker - this is a lifesaver, and stops me from spending useless amounts of time on the internet.
* [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) text editor - I'm a big fan of writing my posts in markdown and this does this really well.
* I love my [Happy Hacking Keyboard](https://happyhackingkb.com/), so much so that I own two of them!
